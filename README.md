"Gabbai": Interactive, backend program organizing logistics and prayer times for an entire community. Using selenium and Python scripting, the Gabbai makes organzing and informing
people of the proper timing for events and prayer, as well as sending updates seamlessly to a community groupchat.
Features of the "Gabbai":
1. For daily afternoon/evening prayer (the time of which changes daily based on sunset), calculate the sunset time and schedule the prayer service accordingly. After the time is calculated, send an update text to a groupchat with the community members
   so that they are well-informed and aware of the schedule for the day to come.
2. For daily morning prayers, send texts individually to people whose responsibility it is to arrive for that specific day, seamlessly by calculating the current day of the week and notifying the correct members accordingly.

Organzing community logistics, especially those that change daily, can be a daunting task, but the "Gabbai" is here to help! Terminal-ran, seamless control.

Use and enjoy!
